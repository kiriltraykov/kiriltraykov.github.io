     <h3>III. Foods Causing the Illnesses</h3>

     <ul class="to-the-left" style="list-style-type:disc">
     <li>We classified all available food descriptions into 6 main categories (Animal-origin, Plant-origin, Bakery, Liquids, Sauces, and Miscellaneous/Unidentifiable) and 21 sub-categories.</li>
     </ul>

     <ul class="to-the-right" style="list-style-type:disc">
     <li>The food cause has been identified in 60% of illnesses. Although hard to isolate the exact food in some cases, there is room to improve findings if information gathering and patient treatment put more emphasis on this field.</li>
     </ul>

      <h3>IV. Myths and findings from research</h3>

      <p>Scientific research (<i>see footnote</i>) has tried to offer explanations that food illnesses occur more often among:</p> 
      <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
      <li>Lower socio-economic groups</li>
      
      <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
      <li>Less education leads to food preparation knowledge gaps and riskier behavior (e.g. people believing that freezing food will kill bacteria)</li>
      <li>Less income leads to lack of resources (e.g. cutting boards, paper towels, disinfectant soaps) to adequately prepare food in sanitary conditions</li>
      </ul>

   
      <li>Ethnic minorities</li>
      
      <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
      <li>Some cultural practices may pose risks (e.g. buying fresh Mexican cheese from independent small stores with poor sanitation)</li>
      <li>Lack of English-language skills to understand proper food preparation practices</li>
      </ul>
      </ul>

      <p>However, the map reveals that neither poorer states (e.g. the South) nor immigrant-heavy ones (e.g. Texas, California) exhibit higher food illness rates per capita as predicted. One explanation could be that people in those income brackets and social groups may not seek medical help unless absolutely required due to cost.</p>

      <h3 class="spaced">V. Place of consumption more important</h3>

      <p class ="to-the-left">We have to look at the place of food illness contraction (89% of illnesses have an identified location of contraction). Scientific research only focuses on food consumption at home, but that only accounts for 14% of illnesses. The majority of cases, 57%, occur elsewhere: in restaurants!</p>

      <p><i>Pie Diagram: Place of consumption, cumulative 2010-2014</i></p>
      <p id="locationnote"><i>"Other" includes school, nursing home, prison, camp, religious facility, fair, hospital, office, and child daycare.</i></p>
      </div>

      <p class ="to-the-left"><b>Thus, to prevent food illnesses, efforts should focus on improving food handling and preparation practices at restaurants, which will impact majority of cases.</b></p>
