		<h3 class="header">II. Restaurants have 2 tries on a given inspection to get a score under 14, which will earn them an A grade:</h3>

		<h3 class="header">III. Under this "two-tries" system, restaurants quickly fix problems encountered on the first inspection and eventually close to 90% of all restaurants earn a grade of A:</h3>

	    <h3 class="header">To spot the issue, we have to take a closer look on timeline basis:</h3>

		<h3 class="header">Situation 1: Restaurants which earn an A on the first try drop their standards. They continue on a yo-yo pattern in subsequent inspections, taking advantage of the "two-tries" system. Their performance is <span id="mark">inconsistent</span>, but they seldom earn any grade less than an A:</h3>

	    <div id="box2">
		<h3 class="header">Situation 2: Restaurants which score >14 on the first try are able to turn it around on the follow-up inspection, but after that, they also oscillate up and down in their performance. They are <span id="mark">also inconsistent</span>:</h3>

		<h2>Overall, we have identified a problem: most restaurants are erratic and any current grade may be misleading of their true state of sanitation and food handling practices.</h2>
