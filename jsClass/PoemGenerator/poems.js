["Another Air", 
       "the horse&#8217s nostrils breathe.<br>\
		And the moist eye <br>\

		Only the habit <br>\
		still prevents him\
		from rattling his hoofs <br>\
		towards the stars.",

		white solitude in my hair <br>\
		so I can dance barefoot <br>\
		across <br>\
		the well-beaten dance floor <br>\
		of our love.",
