       <h1>Sign Language Expression:</h1>
       <h3 class="InTitle">How fit is it for American Spoken Media?</h3>

       <h4>I. Objective</h4>
       <p>This research proposes a new way to think about sign language by considering its <i>efficiency</i> compared to the spoken media world. By collecting word frequency information from spoken broadcasts from ABC, NBC, CBS, CNN, FOX, MSNBC, PBS, NPR, and others between 1990 and 2015, we want to examine whether more frequently spoken words are simpler to express in sign form. If this is true, it will mean that less effort and time is needed by sign language to keep up with the spoke narrative. Thus, in our definition, <i>efficiency</i> means simplicity of expression relative to the frequency of use in spoken media. </p> 

       <div id="Hypothesis">
       <p><i>Efficiency</i> is the tradeoff between frequency and effort.</p> 
       <p>Sign language would be fit for our spoken media world if variability in effort becomes lower as frequency increases.</p>
       </div>

       <p>&nbsp; 

       <h4>II. Methodology</h4>
       <p>To conduct this evaluation, we took the following steps:</p>
       <ul>
       <li><b>1.</b> Measured the highest and lowest points of 257 randomly chosen words in sign form and took their amplitude.</li>
       <li><b>2.</b> Gathered data for the frequency of use of these words in American spoken media per million of spoken words. (<i>see footnote for more details on both measurements)</i></li>
       </ul>
      
       <p>Example: "cowboy"</p>
       <div style='float:left; width:30%'>
       <p style='margin-left:30px; font-size:14px'>Low point for "cowboy": -317px</p>
       </div>

       <div style='float:left; width:40%; margin-left:213px'>
       <p style='font-size:14px'>High point for "cowboy": 56px</p>
       </div>
       
       <img src="cowboy LOW.png" style="width:400px; height:260px;">
       <img src="cowboy HIGH.png" style="width:400px; height:260px;">

      <p>--> Thus, the amplitude for "cowboy" is (56px-(-317px)) = 373 pixels, while the frequency is 6.56 words per million.</p>

       <p>&nbsp;

       <h4>III. Applying quantitative instruments to the entire data set</h4>
       <p>We started our evaluation at "global level" for the entire 257 data points:</p>

       <p><b><i>Instrument 1: Correlation</i></b>: Frequency of use and amplitude have correlation of <b>0.02</b>. This immediately suggests that the two may be independent variables.</p>

       <p><b><i>Instrument 2: Linear Regression</i></b>: To be sure we don't miss something, we will also do a regression. We get that:</p>

       <img src="Regression.png">

       <p>It is noteworthy to point out that:</p>
          <ul>
       <li><b>1.</b> Couter to our hypothesis, higher frequency of use has a positive influence (+0.02) on amplitude.</li>
       <li><b>2.</b> Predictions about amplitude cannot be made because of the very large standard error.</i></li>
       <li><b>3.</b> The same regression coefficients are observed at 90%, 95%, and 99% confidence levels.</i></li>
       </ul>

       <div id="Hypothesis">
       <p>Since both correlation and linear regression offer very weak (non-existant) relationship evidence <br>between frequency of use and amplitude, our preliminary impression is that <i>efficiency</i> will then be a chance event <br>of specific word choice by the narrator that is expressed easily in sign form.</p>
       </div>

        <p>&nbsp;
       
       <h4>IV. Grouping into frequency groups</h4>
       <p>To assess <i>efficiency</i> against our definition, however, we would like to observe how simplicity of expression changes with frequency of use. To do that, we grouped all words into 8 frequency bins so that we can compare like words. For example, even though the words <i>house</i>, <i>road</i>, or <i>grill</i>, have small amplitudes (easy to express) and may be spoken in the same context, we can't directly know if they are <i>efficient</i> unless we view them in the context of their frequencies, which vary dramatically: <i>house</i> is spoken 759 times per million words, while <i>road</i> and <i>grill</i> are spoken 116 and 7 times, respectively.</p>

       </tr>
       </table>

       <p>We observe that as the size of bins decreases, their standard error also shrinks (to less than one word per million).

       <div id="Hypothesis">
       <p>From practical standpoint, other randomly drawn samples would exhibit similar means and distributions <br> for mid-range to less-frequent words, which together comprise <b>85% of all words</b>. <br>The top 15% will always vary when selected at random, but <b>for the rest, grouping properties will be very similar</b>.</p>

       </ul>

       <h4>VI. Applying quantitative instruments to the bins</h4>

        <p><b><i>Instrument 3: Rate of Change:</i></b>

       <p>Ideally, the visualization above would take the shape of a narrowing "funnel", which will mean that variability is shrinking and sign language is getting more <i>efficient</i> at higher frequencies. But because this is difficult to see with the naked eye, we will use three measures of variability (mean, standard deviation, 80%-percentile) and their rate of change to observe this behavior.</p>

       <p>Thus, we would be fishing for negative rates of change from one bin to another.</p> 

      <p>&nbsp; 

       <img src="Rate of Change.png">

       <p style='margin-left:30px; font-size:14px'>Note: The lower boundaries of variability (e.g. the standard deviation below the mean and the 20%-percentile) are not shown because all bins are assumed to share roughly the same floor where amplitudes are small.</p>

       <p>&nbsp;  

       <p>From the graph above, we see that <b>the desired behavior of negative rate of the change from bin to bin only holds for three bins</b>: (1) from Very Rare to Rare; (2) from Mid-Range to High Mid-Range; and (3) from Frequent to Very Frequent. Each of these bins is succeeded by growth in variability, <b>creating a "yo-yo" behavior</b>.</p>

       <p>&nbsp; 

       <p><b><i>Instrument 4: Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)</i></b>

       <p>We found the ANOVA test most appropriate to test the behavior of the variances in each bin and tell us whether we have equal variances across them. Since we can't assume that neither the amplitude, nor the frequency of use is normally distributed, we cannot use F-tests to compare bins. Since we also don't know the theoretical means for the population of words, we cannot make use of a chi-squared test, either.</p>

       <img src="ANOVA.png">

       <p>At 7 degrees of freedom and 95% confidence interval, <b>the ANOVA test leads us to accept the null hypothesis that the variances among the 8 bins do not statistically differ and could be considered equal.</b> (F-value < the <i>critical</i> F-value).</p>

       <p>&nbsp; 

       <h4>VII. Conclusion</h4>
       <p>Expressing news in sign language requires <i>efficiency</i> in order to keep up with the media narrative. In this research, we investigated whether more commonly used words have progressively lesser amplitude of expression, making them easier and faster to convey. We conducted several quantitative tests (1. Correlation, 2. Linear Regression, 3. Rate of Change, 4. ANOVA test) to help us deal with the uncertainty. However, all of them point out to the same conclusion that:</p>

       <div id="Hypothesis">
       <p><b>Sign language is not structurally fit to follow media language. <br>We found that variability in expression does not follow a steady trend, <br>but is increasing and decreasing at different frequencies, making it independent from the frequency of use.</b><p> 
       </div>

       <p>&nbsp; 

       <h4>VIII. Implications</h4>
       <p>The results of this research could be important for media policy-making. The implication is that it may not be appropriate for sign language to be put in simultaneous broadcast stream with spoken language. Perhaps sign language needs its own channel to ensure that everything is communicated without delay or hurriedness, as could be the case if sign language was pegged to follow spoken media language.</p>
